**Problem Statement**


The management team at Atliq Hardwares has observed a significant gap in their ability to make timely, data driven decisions. Despite having access to vast amounts of data, the insights generated are not sufficiently
actionable, hindering the organization's responsiveness and strategic agility. This issue is exacerbated by the
current team's limited capacity to analyze and interpret data effectively, leading to slower decision-making
processes and missed opportunities for optimization


**Data Extraction and Preparation:**

Data Sources: We accessed various datasets from our data repositories, including logs from analytics
platforms, data quality reports, and records of insight utilization.
SQL Queries: We employed Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract and aggregate relevant data for
analysis. This involved writing and executing complex queries to pull comprehensive data sets that span
across different aspects of our analytics and decision-making processes.
